# HTML Project - Phase I

This is my personal portfolio wesbite, where I showcase my skills and projects. I have designed three pages for this wesbite
1. **index.html** - The front page of the website. This page has an **About me** section, where I introduce myself. I also present my education details and known skills in this page.
2. **portfolio.html** - This page shows the projects that I have done.
3. **contact.html** - A page having my contact details

My website features a dark theme with minimal elements, giving it a professional look. I have organized my educational details and projects using `div` elements, which provides a neater layout. Some hover effects have also been added to enhance interactivity.
